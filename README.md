# üêá Zod Env
**Functional mixin that adds "envParse" to [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for
conditionally disabling run-time parsing**  

## Motivation


<img align="right" src="https://github.com/schalkventer/zod-env/assets/14258328/e2927281-f07f-47d2-a1c6-40945ed3b6c6" width="600">Primarily inspired by a
[Yehonathan&nbsp;Sharvit](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming)'s
usage of conditional validation using [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/) as
part of a
[data&#8209;oriented&nbsp;programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design)
approach.

There are several benefits to using Zod over AJV, such as the automatic
inference of types based on the created run-time schema. Howvever, Zod was primarily
designed for strict type-safety, especially at the edges of your data
ingress and egress. Therefore, Zod does not naturally lend itself to
weaker-typed TypeScript or pure JavaScript projects. 

Furthermore, due to the nature of Zod's schema inference, it is several orders of
magnitude slower than AJV. This means that even when using Zod in a strict type-safety 
manner, there might still be performance benefits to disabling run-time validation 
in production.

This plugin provides the above, while still preserving Zod's type inference
functionality.

## Usage

```bash
npm install zod zod-env
```

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { withEnv } from 'zod-env'

const person = withEnv(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
    age: z.number().int().min(0),
}))

const value = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@doe.com',
    age: 24,
}

const result = person.envParse(value)
```

The following `.ENV` variable will disable run-time checking:

```dockerfile
NODE_ENV="production"
```

All other values, for example `development`, will enable run-time checking.

You can create your own `withEnv` if for custom ENV variable logic:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { createWithEnv } from 'zod-env'

const withEnv = createWithEnv({
    MY_ENV: 'strict',
    REACT_APP_CUSTOM_ENV: /^enable-.*/i,
}, true)

const person = withEnv(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
    age: z.number().int().min(0),
}))

const value = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@doe.com',
    age: 24,
}

const result = person.envParse(value)
```

The `createWithEnv` constructor accepts the following arguments:

- An object of ENV variables kev-value pairs to match against in the `.ENV`
  file. Accepts both `string` and regular expressions. Note that it is
  considered a match if any of the key-value pairs are present in the `.ENV`
  file.

- An optional boolean that determines whether run-time checking should be
  enabled or disabled if a match is detected. By default this is set to `false`,
  meaning that run-time checking will disabled if a match is detected. 

For example the presence of any of the following will enable run-time checking.
All other cases will disable run-time checking.

```dockerfile
MY_ENV="strict"
```

```dockerfile
REACT_APP_CUSTOM_ENV="enabled-latest-app
```
